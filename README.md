Morphological image segmentation scripts for CT scans. All scripts take an image, an optional vector of units, and possibly a mask of voxels to ignore. All scripts can be run with just the image, although the accuracy may be degraded.

These scripts were used to generate training data for a deep neural network.

All scripts require the [aimutil](https://github.com/bbrister/aimutil) repository to work. This is included as a Git submodule for convenience.
